# simple-interpreter
• Created an interpreter developed in C which evaluates text files containing lines of code and prints out the value of each variable.
• Used Binary Search Trees, Heap sort for storing variables and their values, and Stacks for evaluating each line.
• Worked in a team of 4 with the help of Git version control.
